# NFS

A (very) simple implementation of a Network File System (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System)
It is a simple socket comunication between a server and a client, where a
cliente will have a shell and can send commands to be executed on the server
file system such as create, rename, readdir and remove.

We have two examples, one with java and the other using go. They pretty much do
the same thing.
